# Heritage bilingualism



- Heritage speakers (HS):  **Early bilinguals** with a societal minority language at home and are exposed to a societal majority language in the community. 

  * Early bilingual phonological grammars interact during early childhood (Fabiano-Smith & Barlow, 2010; Lleó, 2018; Meziane & MacLeod, 2021; Paradis, 2001). 


  * Dominance shift heritage language → majority language during **primary school** <font size="2">(Benmamoun, Montrul, & Polinsky, 2013; Flores & Rato, 2016; Kupisch et al., 2015; Lloyd-Smith, Einfeldt, & Kupisch,2020; Polinsky & Scontras, 2020; Valdés, 2014)</font>.
 

  * Adult HS demonstrate areas of **vulnerability in the heritage language** (HL):  divergent productions from monolingual norms, cross-linguistic transfer from the dominant language <font size="2">(Amengual, 2012, 2016; Kim, 2017; Rao, 2014; Ronquest, 2013)</font>, output variation <font size="2">(Kupisch, 2020)</font>, 'heritage accent' <font size="2">(Flores & Rato, 2016; Kupisch et al., 2015; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2020).</font>


 

  
  - **Are the divergent outputs found during adulthood (attrition of the heritage language) or do they arise during early grammar interaction**?

# Areas of vulnerability


- HSs mostly maintain separate **phonemic contrasts** <font size="2">(Chang et al., 2011; Llama & López-Morelos, 2016; Saadah, 2011; Tse, 2016)</font>.

- HSs demonstrate output variation and ‘intermediate values’ in their **phonetic implementation** <font size="2">(Amengual, 2016, 2018; Chang & Yao, 2016; Kim, 2011)</font>.


- Less studied area in HSs speech production is that of coarticulation. Although the effects of coarticulation are often not audible <font size="2">(Farnetani & Recasens, 2010)</font> and, thus, less likely to contribute to a global heritage accent, understanding variation in language-specific **gestural organization** can shed light on the architecture of heritage language grammars. 


- Coordination of tautosyllabic and heterosyllabic consonant clusters involving a tap (i.e.,/Cɾ/, /ɾ.C/).
  

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}

How robust are these representations and how does this robustness change as heritage speakers develop their grammars?

# Spanish /Cɾ/ and /ɾC/ clusters

- Spanish tap is produced with a primary gesture of the tip of the tongue involving a single rapid ballistic movement (hit-and-run) with the alveolar ridge and a secondary uvular gesture of the tongue body <font size="2">(Proctor, 2011)</font>. 

In consonant clusters:

-	Tautosyllabic position
  *	[tɾen] tren ‘train’  
  *	[fɾe.sa] fresa ‘strawberry’
  *	[o.ɣɾo] ogro ‘ogre’
  *	[gɾan.xa] granja ‘farm’
-	Heterosyllabic position
  *	[aɾ.βol] árbol  ‘tree’
  *	[aɾ.ma.ɾjo] armario ‘closet’
  *	[peɾ.fek.to] perfecto ‘perfect’

# Spanish /Cɾ/ and /ɾ.C/ gestural coordination

- Spanish consonant clusters containing a tap (e.g., /Cɾ/ ‘tronco’ and /ɾ.C/ ‘árbol’) optionally surface with an **intrusive vowel (IV)** ' (e.g., /ɾə.C/ or /Cəɾ/) ranging from 63% to 97.7%  <font size="2">(Blecua, 2001; Colantoni and Steele, 2006; Ramirez, 2006; Schmeiser, 2020)</font>.

- IVs are invisible to the phonology (e.g., no repair of syllabic structure, invisible to stress assignment) and may be a by-product of consonant coarticulation. 

- Intrusive vowels are not stable in their durational properties <font size="2">(Gili Gaya, 1921)</font>.  Generally, IV duration is similar to that of an unstressed vowel <font size="2">(Malmberg, 1965: 10, 35)</font>, and appears to be longer to that of the tap (27.9 ms vs. 20.5 ms) <font size="2">(Blecua, 2001; Gil Gaya, 1921)</font>.

- Articulatory phonology <font size="2">(Browman and Goldstein 1989, 1990, 1991:Gafos, 1999, 2002)</font>:

  * Grammar operates on dynamically defined articulatory gestures which are coordinated in-phase (i.e., sinchronously) or in anti-phase (i.e., sequentially).
  * Consonants superimposed on vowel gesture.
  * Low degree of overlap between consonantal gestures allows for open transitions.

SV duration varies according to
how similar the two consonants in the cluster are in terms of
obstruent voicing, manner of articulation, and place of
articulation
It is a standard working hypothesis in the study of speech that phonological units
(such as segments or syllables or higher structures such as feet or prosodic words) are
embodied in actions of the speech gestures that constitute these units. Yet, variation
in interarticulatory timing, in particular, has proven nettlesome in teasing apart the
phonologically encoded constraints that act on the dynamic actions of the different
articulators and the low level biomechanical constraints that may affect interarticulatory
timing (Gafos & Goldstein, 2012).
- EVs appear at rates of 85% and 97%, more often in /Cɾ/ than in /ɾ.C/ and duration is 

Schmeiser (2020)
Of the 812 total /CR/ clusters examined, 521 /CR/ clusters
contained SVs and a Spanish tap, resulting in an occurrence rate
of 64.16%, a percentage in line with Blecua’s study (2001:
63%) on rhotics, and Ramírez (2006: 68%). In what follows, I
offer for each hypothesis a graph of the mean SV duration for
each factor tested.



That is, intrasegmental timing
(the timing between the laryngeal abduction gesture and the oral constriction for the
stop) interacts with intersegmental timing (the lag between the two oral constrictions
of the /k/ and the /l/).

so-called intrusive vocoid that often appears between the two
consonants in Spanish onset clusters (Bradley, 2006; Gili Gaya, 1921; Lenz, 1892;
Malmberg, 1965; Menéndez Pidal, 1926)



In sum, our assessment of overlap in clusters reveals the following results. As predicted
in H3, IPI was found to be modulated by the gesture that occupies the C2 position.
IPI was significantly higher in clusters where the C2 is a tap as compared to laterals.
C1 place was also found to affect the overlap of the gestural plateaus in both stop
+ lateral and voiceless stop + tap clusters. Additionally, we hypothesized in the Introduction
that Spanish would pattern with French with regard to low gestural overlap
for voiceless stop clusters (H3) and would show no effect of C1 voicing on intergestural
timing in C1C2 clusters (H3). Our predictions were partially confirmed in that
Spanish clusters are characterized by low gestural overlap. However, in contrast to
French, this interval is additionally modulated by the voicing specification of C1,
which resembles Bombien and Hoole’s (2013) finding on German but not on French
(we return to this finding in the Discussion section). Finally, the results indicate that
overlap in our data is not modulated by the vowel that follows the consonant clusters.

no difference in voicing for rC

- word position:
  - order of constriction: longer IVs in front to back order of cosntriction than back to front
- manner of articulation: stops will evidence the shortest duration, followed by approximants, and nasals
- plac of articulation: labials will evidence the shortest duration followed by coronals and dorsals

Intrusive vowel duration: 
  
  longer iV after a voiced consonant than a voiceless one

fewer research in rC than cr (only Romero 1996, 2008, Bradley 2004) have included vowel intrusion in rC clusters

Gili Gaya 1921: /rC/ tokens 61.2% contain an EV in all clusters in which a tap was realized.


Bradley (2004): /rd/ execution of the release phase of the rhotic, which separates the tap constriction from that of the following consonant, ensuring an open transition between the two

Romero (2008): IV epiphenomena by product of the temporal overlap between articulatory gestures, not the result of a deliberate process of insertion





Colantoni and Steele (In press) argue that epenthesis is a dissimilatory process which
serves to increase the articulatory and perceptual difference between the stop and rhotic.

Such vocalic elements appear to be at the interface between phonetics and phonology. The degree to which such vowels are phonologized is debated.



Such intrusive vocoids (IV henceforth) indicate a low consonant-to-consonant overlap and a high degree of intergestural timing, which, moreover, has been found to be modulated by voicing (Gibson et al., 2019). Unlike in Spanish, consonant clusters containing /ɹ/ in English (e.g., crow [kɹo]) do not demonstrate vocalic epenthesis (Colantoni & Steele, 2006). We predict that the probabilistic nature of IVs along with the higher gestural overlap in English will likely result in lower rates of IVs in Spanish HSs when compared to Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments.

# English /Cɹ/ /ɹC/ clusters

- Taps in American English surface as a result of the application of the flapping rule in V_V environments (e.g., bu[ɾ]er). 

- Otherwise, American English has a voiced alveolar approximant in the phonemic inventory (i.e., [ɹ]) which surfaces in consonant clusters (e.g., [bɹeɪn] brain [ɑɹm] arm).

- Consonant clusters in English exhibit considerable temporal overlap and negligible rates of intrusive vowels (Catford 1988).

# Research questions

**Phonetic context**

RQ1: Is presence and duration of IV affected by segmental features such as voicing and place of articulation?

HA: **Perceptual recoverability**: Shared features with the tap (e.g., voicing, coronal) will be likely to lead to greater rates of IVs.


RQ2: Is presence and duration of IV affected by strength of lingual constriction (**mastery of tap realization**?

HA: **Articulatory based account**: Stronger lingual constrictions will be more likely to encode low gestural overlap. 


---

# Research questions


RQ3: Does gestural coordination show development between the ages of 5 and when compared to adults?


- Development of speech motor control will result in more variable occurrence of IV and durational differences.

---

# Research questions


RQ4a: Does transfer in the gestural specification of /ɾC/ and /Cɾ/ clusters arise between the Spanish and English grammars in Spanish heritage speakers (HSs)? If so, as Spanish heritage speakers develop their two grammars, do they show a different pattern of gestural specification?



- RQ4a:

HA:  If transfer arises between the Spanish and English grammars, Spanish HSs will produce lower rates of IVs with shorter duration when compared to SpanMonoSs.

RQ4b: 


- HA1: **Shift in language dominance**: adult HSs will present more gestural overlap (i.e., lower rates of IV with shorter duration) than child HSs.

- HA2: **Early grammar interaction**: child HSs will present more gestural overlap than adult HSs.

# Data collection

- Semi-spontaneous speech collected with 'Frog, where are you?' (Mayer, 1969) ('frasco' *jarr*, 'piedra' *stone*, 'árbol' *tree*) recorded with SmartPhone App ShurePlusMotiv (48Khz 16 bits).

- Data manually transcribed and segmented using Montreal Forced Aligner (McAuliffe et al., 2017)

- Taps and trills manually identified and annotated.

- EVs manually segmented and EV duration using Praat 6.3.

- Speech rate calculated using Praat Script Syllable Nuclei v2 (de Jong and Wempe, 2008)

# Interim summary: Duration of IV

- IVs flanking a voiced consonant and a tap are longer than those flanking a voiceless consonant.

- IVs in heterosyllabic clusters are longer than IVs in tautosyllabic clusters.

- IVs neighboring true taps are longer than IVs neighboring approximant taps.

- Children produce longer IVs than adults.

- No differences between participant groups.

# Discussion

RQ1: Is presence and duration of IV affected by segmental features such as voicing and place of articulation?


IVs occur more frequently when the following or preceding consonant is voiced, has a dorsal place of articulation and is not a fricative.

IVs are longer in /Cɾ/ than in /ɾC/ clusters.

# Discussion


RQ1: Is presence and duration of IV affected by segmental features such as voicing and place of articulation?

- **Recoveravility hyptohesis**: Voiced environments and underlying plosives favor occurrence of IV, providing support for vocoid intrusion to optimize tap perception.

- Dorsal environments: front consonants followed by back consonants tend to be more overlapped than back consonants followed by front consonants <font size="2">(Byrd, 1996)</font>
  * Labials have unobstructed release would favor overlap.
  * Same place of articulation for coronals would favor overlap.
  * Greater extended contact area of tongue dorsum leading to longer IV duration <font size="2">(Schmeiser, 2020)</font>.


- Longer IVs in /ɾC/ clusters than in /Cɾ/ clusters: IVs in /ɾC/ are in less stable relationship with the flanking consonants <font size="2">(Goldstein, Byrd, and Saltzman, 2006)</font>. Greater unstability may lead to longer duration.  Similarly, Schmeiser (2007) found that /ɾC/ clusters are less affected by segmental factors.








---

# Discussion


RQ2: Is presence and duration of IV affected by strength of lingual constriction (**mastery of tap realization**?

- Greater rate of IVs in true taps than in approximant taps supports an **articulatory-based model** of IV production. Decrease in time between tongue body retraction and alveolar constriction may favor close transition and more gestural overlap between the consonant and the tap.




---

# Discussion

RQ3: Does gestural coordination show development between the ages of 5 and when compared to adults?


- IVs appear less often in children than in adults, but when children produce IVs, they do so with longer duration and more variability. 

  * Speech coarticulation found to be developed up until the 7 years of age <font size="2">(Nittrouer, 1993)</font>. 
  * Overshooting the target and greater variability while developing global control for timing relationships <font size="2">(Barton & Macken, 1980; Hitchcock & Koenig, 2013; Lee et al., 1999; Payne et al, 2017; Potter, 2004)</font>. 
  
  
  
  


---

# Discussion

RQ4: Does transfer in the gestural specification of /ɾC/ and /Cɾ/ clusters arise between the Spanish and English grammars in Spanish heritage speakers (HSs)? Does it change during development.


- No, gestural timing from English (greater overlap) does not appear to influence timing in Spanish clusters.

  * Heritage bilinguals show distinct coarticulatory vowel nasalization patterns in Spanish and English <font size="2">(Beristain, to appear)</font>. 
  * Gestural implementation of articulatory coordination may be more robust than more salient perceptual features. 


---

# Conclusion: Segmental factors

- Partial support for **speech recoverability** gestural encoding of consonant coordination.


- Physical articulatory constraints may favor IVs in dorsal flanking consonants and disfavor them in approximant taps.


-  Degree of coordination with the vowel gesture may lead to longer IVs.

---

# Conclusion: Language development

- Gestural timing (minimal overlap) develops during primary school years (between 5 and 11 years of age).
  * Lower presence of IVs.
  * Target overshoot
- Gestural coordination appears to be stable in heritage language grammars.
