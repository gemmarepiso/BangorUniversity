# Introduction

- A heritage language is a sociopolitically minority and/or minoritized language acquired as the first or one of the first languages in a bilingual or multilingual context (Montrul, 2023), resulting in **unbalanced bilingualism**.


 
- **Dominance shift** towards the majority language as they gain exposure to the majority language &lt;font size="3"&gt; (Benmamoun, Montrul, &amp; Polinsky, 2013; Flores &amp; Rato, 2016; Kupisch et al., 2015; Lloyd-Smith, Einfeldt, &amp; Kupisch,2020; Polinsky &amp; Scontras, 2020; Valdés, 2014)&lt;/font&gt;.





???

Alright so let's start defining heritage speakers. Heritage bilinguals are early bilinguals exposed to a societal minority language at home and a societal majority language in the community. It is believed that at the onset of schooling heritage speakers undergo a **Dominance shift** towards the majority language as they gain exposure to the latter, which may result in divergent attainment in adult grammars. This dominance shift may be at the center of what has been identified as a 'heritage accent' in the speech system of heritage speakers. In the context of this talk I examine **Spanish-English bilinguals raised in California with Spanish as their home language.**

---
# Introduction



 
**Adult heritage speakers**


- Heritage speakers demonstrate a ‘heritage accent’ in the heritage language &lt;font size="3"&gt;(Flores &amp; Rato, 2016; Kupisch et al., 2015; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2020)&lt;/font&gt; 

- Maintenance of phonemic contrast but output variation in the phonetic implementation  &lt;font size="3"&gt;(Amengual,2012; Au et al., 2002, 2008; Godson, 2004; Elias et al., 2017; Hrycyna et al., 2011; Henriksen, 2015; Kang &amp; Nagy, 2016; Kim, 2011; Nagy &amp; Kochetov, 2013; Ronquest, 2013, 2016;van de Weijer &amp; Kupisch, 2015; Willis, 2005)&lt;/font&gt;.


 **Bilingual preschoolers**



-  Bilingual preschoolers also show grammar interaction between their two grammars resulting in deceleration, acceleration, or transfer &lt;font size="2"&gt; (Vihman 1985, Lleó, &amp; Rakow, 2004; Kehoe et al., 2004; Lleó, 2003, 2016b; Lleó &amp; Kehoe, 2002) &lt;/font&gt;.

# Introduction







&lt;img src="outcomes_graph.png" width="1000px" /&gt;

???

 So, just to visualize it, imagine the X-axis representing the years of a speaker, and the Y-axis representing the percentage of acquisition of a certain sound. We have data from bilingual preschoolers showing a decelerated rate in their acquisition, and we have data from adult heritage speakers showing divergent outcomes when compared to canonical descriptions of the grammar resulting in heritage accent.

Now, the question is, how do we connect the dots between the research that we have in the preschool years to the results that we have for early adults? In other words, we're missing crucial data during these speakers' school-age period. This data is crucial because it marks the point at which heritage speakers shift dominance from their heritage to their majority language.
---

# Introduction



&lt;img src="graph_attrition.png" width="1000px" /&gt;




???
One possible way of connecting the dots is by considering a scenario in which attrition occurs, wherein heritage speakers acquire the main articulatory properties of a sound or phonological process, but, as a result of a dominance or proficiency shift, a phonological contrast, details of the phonetic implementation of certain sounds, or a specific application of a phonological process are lost, which results in these divergent outcomes during adulthood. 






---
# Introduction



- Areas of vulnerability in heritage languages?

  * Vulnerable areas may encompass complex phenomena that require more cognitive resources (e.g., long-distance dependencies, encoding multiple relationships between constituents, interpretation of null elements &lt;font size="3"&gt; (Laleko &amp; Scontras, 2021; Scontras &amp; Polinsky, 2020)&lt;/font&gt;.
  
  * **Vulnerable areas in speech production**: articulatorily difficult sounds, phonological phenomena at the interfaces, phenomena related to speech segmentation.



???

Now, another question that we need to ask whene xamining heritage speaers is: what are the areas of vulnerability in heritage language grammars? In the morphosyntactic domain, recent reviews have noticed that vulnerable areas are those that require more cognitive resources such as long-distance depencendies, encoding multiple relationships such as case and agreement between constituents, or the interpretation and production of null elements. Now, in the sound system of heritage speakers we can think that some of these vulnerable areas may entail sounds that are difficult from an articulatroy perspective, phonological pheneomena that are at the interface with other linguistic modules, such as syntax, or pragmatics since they increase the cognitive load, or pheneomena related to speech segmentation that have a relationship with lexical access since .

 However, effects of the majority language on the heritage language are not unique to adult speakers. The literature on bilingual preschoolers also shows that two grammars interact from the onset of speech production and, when compared to monolinguals, they show deceleration, acceleration, and transfer. In most cases what we observe when the linguistic feature is absent in the majority language is that the effects of the majority language lead to deceleration in the acquisition of the heritage language. For example, to continue our example with stops voicing, a recent study showed that while bilingual preschoolers can use their two languages to differentiate between voiced and voiceless stops, discrimination is more mature in English than in Spanish.

# Overview

Do we observe attrition in heritage speakers' learning trajectories of complex phenomena in the Spanish sound system?




  * Connected speech in Spanish heritage speakers: child HSs greater transfer from English than adult HSs *(Repiso-Puigdelliura &amp; Kim, 2023)*.

  * Rhotic system in Spanish heritage speakers: maintenance of phonemic contrast but deceleration in the acquisition of complex articulatory representations *(Perry &amp; Repiso-Puigdelliura, in preparation; Repiso-Puigdelliura &amp; Kim, 2021)*

 
.content-box-blue[

- No dominance shift observed in cross-sectional designs, instead child heritage grammars more vulnerable to pressure from majority language than adult grammars.

In this talk, I will explore the learning trajectories of early bilinguals specifically those who are speakers of a heritage language. To address this question, I will focus on the rhotic system as a test case . I will present findings from three studies in which I ask Do adult heritage speakers show attrition in their **trills** when compared to child heritage speakers?, Does the development of **intrusive vowels in taps in consonant clusters** show  differential development in heritage speakers when compared to Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments, Do child and adult Spanish heritage speakers maintain the **trill-tap contrast** using duration The patterns in the acquisition of the spanosh Luz maria Vazquez Carranza

I will argue that, when comparing Spanish heritage speakers to monolingual speakers, there is evidence of decelerated development in the rhotic system. However, in cross-sectional designs comparing Spanish heritage speakers to Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments, a continued developmental trajectory is observed. This scenario sheds light on previous accounts of heritage speakers' language development.

# Research questions 

 Does grammar interaction occur in the Spanish and English grammars of HSs in connected speech?
  - RQ1: What is the **rate of glottal phonation** in Spanish-English heritage bilinguals both for Spanish when compared to age-matched monolinguals ?

  - RQ2: Does the effect of **stress** mediate rate of glottal phonation in the phonologies of heritage bilinguals and age-matched monolingually-raised speakers?

Does grammar interaction decrease as HSs mature?

  - RQ3: How does the rate of glottal phonation vary with **age** in Spanish?

&lt;p1&gt;
Before explaining the results, I would like to take a moment to explain which acoustic correlates I used for the data analysis. First, I want to talk about the identification of acoustic correlates for glottalization. The glottal stop that occurs between words in English can be realized in two ways. It can be a complete closure with a closure of the larynx, or it can be incomplete, with what we call creaky voice or vocal fry, where the vocal cords vibrate at a slow and irregular speed. Glottal stops appear in the spectrogram as a period of silence between the consonant and the vowel, as we can see highlighted in the left figure within the green box. Creaky voice has a few acoustic correlates: the glottal pulses, which are these vertical lines we see in the spectrogram, are irregular; the sound wave also shows irregularity in amplitude, and the fundamental frequency, which is this line we see here, appears interrupted.
&lt;/p1&gt; 


---
# Acoustic correlates

- Lack of robust acoustic correlates of resyllabification &lt;font size="3"&gt;(Lahoz-Bengoechea &amp; Jiménez-Bravo, 2021; Strycharczuk &amp; Kohlberger, 2016)&lt;/font&gt;.

- Modal voice: Regular and periodic vibration of the vocal cords.

&lt;img src="./assets/img/elojomarked.png" width="500px" /&gt;




]




???
&lt;p1&gt;

As for the acoustic correlates of resyllabification, unfortunately, resyllabification is part of what is called the "hidden structure" in phonology and does not have direct acoustic correlates. However, since I am comparing it with the structure of English, which does have direct correlates for glottalization, what I do is classify sequences that are not produced with glottalization as sequences with modal voice, and I use it as a proxy for resyllabification. Modal voice occurs when the vocal cords vibrate regularly and periodically. Now let's look at the green box in the image. By identifying this in the spectrogram, we can see that the glottal pulses are regular, and the amplitude of the sound wave remains regular as well.

&lt;/p1&gt;

&lt;p1&gt;
Now let's look at the graph displaying the data. Well, in this graph, we have, on the x-axis, three age groups: children aged 5 to 8 years, 8 to 11 years, and adults. On the y-axis, we have the glottalization proportion. In colors, we can see the two speaker groups: in blue, speakers of Spanish as their first language in Mexico, and in gray, heritage Spanish speakers in California. First of all, we observe that the bars for speakers of Spanish as their first language in Mexico remain low. In contrast, the gray bars show a descending pattern. That is, children aged 5 to 8 produce more glottalization than children aged 8 to 11, and children aged 8 to 11 produce more glottalization than adults. When I compare the speaker groups, furthermore, I find that there are significant differences between the speakers in Mexico and the speakers in California in the children's groups but not in the adult group.

# Interim discussion

#  Transfer in connected speech

Do Spanish heritage speakers transfer strategies from the majority to the heritage language?

- Higher rate of glottal phonation in HS than Spanish monolingual speakers affected by stress.

- **Connected speech is a site for cross-linguistic transfer**. 

  - Transfer of strategies from the majority language in areas that are costly (implications for word retrieval).

  - Prominence-mediated phenomena (stress) are areas of vulnerability in the heritage language grammar (Bullock, 2008; Kim 2019).


Does language transfer decrease with age?

- Child heritage language grammars are **more permeable** to transfer than adult grammars.

On the other hand, the trill is canonically produced 2-3 brief tongue-tip contacts with the alveolar ridge. Here we can see three occlusions: so three dips in the intensity signal as represented by the yellow line, the lack of energy in these areas and the reduction of amplitude in the soundwave. The acquisition of the trill occurs after the age of five or six and this is because Trilling is complex as it requires a complex coordination of articulators and a sufficient amount of oropharyngeal pressure.However, we also have child super trillers. It is also important to acknowledge the dialectal variation in the production of the trill, as it has been reported to show fricative or approximant variants. However, most of the speakers that I will be presenting here are of Mexico and specifically Central and Northern Mexico where a predominant variety is the apicolavoeolar trill. Finally, it is important to note that the trill is not part of the English phonemic inventory.

???
Now, let's explore the various realizations of these rhotic sounds in different phonological contexts:Word-initially such as in red or after a heterosyllabic consonant such as in alrededor only the trill appears. After a tautosyllabic consonant, as in the word ['bɾu.xa] for 'witch.' only the tap appears. In intervocalic position the tap and trill contrast, we find them intervocalic, creating distinctions as seen in ['pe.ɾo] for 'but' and ['pe.ro] for '(male) dog.' Additionally, in taps preceding consonant in heterosyllabic position, the rhotic appears in free variation between a tap or a trill ['aɾ.βol] for 'tree.'

]
???
But, what do we know about trill production in child bilinguals? Studies on bilinguals during early childhood show that Up to 4 y.o. bilingual children show delayed development when compared to monolingual children. Results from one study also show that children produce trills with more occlusions and more targetlike with age, reaching 80% of acquisition around the age of 11. The differential rates of trill acquisition have been attributed to grammar interaction due to markedness of the sound. When we examine adults, studies show that adult heritage speakers present trills with fewer occlusions, shorter duration, and more frication than homeland speakers. So, in this study we ask, are the results that we observe in the adult heritage speakers a result of attrition? That is, do children between 9 to 10 years acquire trills with 2 to 3 occlusions and these trills subsequently weaken when these speakers reach adulthood?





    - Does the difference in rates of acquisition arise from the presence of a different rhotic system in the majority language?
    
    - Does the difference in rates of acquisition arise from weaker word-objects connections in the lexicon (PRIMIR)?
    
    - Does the difference in rates of acquisition arise from fewer opportunities to practice articulatory complexity? Articulatory complexity has been found to correlate with consonant accuracy (40% for the variance in consonant accuracy in English) (Stokes &amp; Surandran, 2005).
    - This difficulty may arise from articulatory complexity (McGowan, Nittrouer &amp;
Manning, 2004; Solé, 2002) or due to its ambiguous phonological status with respect to place of articulation (Goad &amp; Rose, 2004; Rose, 2000).

We classified the variants in trill variants, fricative variants, and tap variants. First, for the trill variants, let's see some example. This is a trill with two strong occlusions because we can see here clearly the two constrictions in the spectrogram. We see a clear dip in the amplitude of the sound wave, a lack of energy in the spectrogram and this dip in the yellow line which shows a reduction in the intensity. Next we see a trill with weak occlusions. According to descriptions in previous studies, this type of occlusion is produced by approaching the tongue to the alveolar ridge without creating a complete constriction. We can still observe two occlusions but in this case the occlusions are weaker, there is no clear break in the formant structure, and the dip in the intensity is not as clear in the yellow line nor in the sound wave. Next we move to the fricative variants, these are phonemic trills that are produced with frication noise instead of trilling, presumably due to a lack of achievement of the trilling. Finally, we have phonemic trills produced with one constriction instead of two, that is phonemic trill produced as taps. In this case, we also have taps that have a clear strong constriction and taps that have weaker constrictionss.



To examine target-like production, we grouped both phonetic and approximant trills as target-like productions. We ran a logistic regression with target-like trill as the dependent variable. We treated number of occlusions as a continuous variables and we ran a linear mixed effects model. Fixed effects were group adults or children, position (word initial or word medial) and their interaction. We allowed the intercepts for participant and word to freely vary.

???

Regarding number of occlusions, our model showed a main effect of age and a main effect of position, suggesting that child heritage speakers produce a lower rate of occlusions that adult heritage speakers and that trill in word-medial position, when contrastive with the tap, are produced with a greater number of occlusions than trills in word-initial position.

The graph on top shows the proportion of the distribution of each variant with grey for the adults and dark blue for the children. In the x axis we have the realizations going from phonetic trill in the left approximant trill, fricative variants, and tap variants int he right. What I want to show you in the graph is that the majority of the realizations of the adults concentrate around trill and fricative variants and the majority of the realizations of the children concentrate around the fricative and tap variation.

# Interim discussion



RQ1: Do heritage speakers show attrition in their production of the trill?





.content-box-blue[

- Adult heritage speakers produce a higher rate of target-like trills and number of occlusions than child heritage speakers. **Divergent attainment** not due to attrition between 9-10- y.o. and adulthood.

  - Child HS: inventories mostly with tap variant and fricative variants. 

  - Adult HS: inventories mostly with fricative variants and trill variants (exploit language-internal variability to avoid markedness [Kupisch, 2020])

  - Spanish trill development may occur in the order of single lingual constriction → frication → multiple lingual constrictions

]

RQ2: Is there an effect of position on heritage speakers’ productionof the Spanish trill?

.content-box-purple[

- Word-medial trills produced more often as target-like and with higher number of occlusions (phonemically contrastive positions).

]    

???

Going back to the research questions, we asked whether heritage speakers show attrition in their production of the trill. Our results showed that, contrary to a hypothesis of attrition, Adult heritage speakers produce a higher rate of target-like trills and number of occlusions than child heritage speakers. This means that, 9-to-10 y.o. are still developing phonetic trill, which is later than monolinguals. We also observed that adults keep some of the tap variants in their inventories. That is, instead of transferring segments from English,they may exploit language-internal variability to avoid markedness. This also suggests that Spanish trill development may occur in the order of single lingual constriction → frication → multiple lingual constrictions. Finally, our findings show that the trill is more stable (showing more occlusions and a greater rate of target-like realizations) in phonemic contrastive position than in non-phonemic contrastivie position. And this is in line with findings showing that heritage speakers maintain phonemic contrasts but diverge in their phonetic implementation. 

This could suggest that heritage speakers have a more robust encoding of rhotics in phonemically contrastive positions, where the trilling has a high functional load than in contexts in which trilling has a lower functional load.

# Phonetic realization of the Spanish tap-trill contrast according to age and language background

(Repiso-Puigdelliura &amp; Perry, in preparation)


???

We have examined taps and trills separately, in this last part, I present a study in collaboration with Scott Perry in which we examine the maintenance of the tap-trill contrast.

---
# Tap-trill phonemic maintenance



- Adult heritage speakers show trills with fewer occlusions, shorter duration, and more frication than homeland speakers &lt;font size="3"&gt;(Henriksen, 2105; Kissling, 2018)&lt;/font&gt;.



- Do Spanish heritage speakers use secondary cues to maintain the tap trill contrast?

- Duration as a cue to maintain phonemic contrast in heritage speakers speech production &lt;font size="3"&gt;(Amengual, 2016; Bradley and Willis 2012; Henriksen and Willis 2010; Willis and Bradley 2008) and L1 speakers' perception Melero-Garcia and Cisneros (2020)&lt;/font&gt;.



???

Although studies have found that heritage speakers show a greater rate of non-target-like trill realizations, such as trills produced as fricatives or taps, it has been suggested that, even if trilling is not acquired, tap-trill maintenance is maintained with secondary cues such as duration. In a perception study, for example, Melero-Garcia and Cisneros (2020) found that Spanish L1 speakers use duration as a cue to distinguish between taps and trills, with the rate of trill selection increasing with duration.
However we do not know of any study that have examined tap-trill contrast as the two segments develop.

---
# Questions

RQ1: Is the tap-trill contrast maintained with duration in Spanish heritage speakers? Does it vary with age?

RQ2: Are taps and trills more unstable (more variation) in Spanish heritage speakers than in Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments? Does it vary with age?

???

In this last study, we ask Is the tap-trill contrast maintained with duration in Spanish heritage speakers? Does it vary with age? and Are taps and trills more unstable (more variation) in Spanish heritage speakers than in Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments? Does it vary with age?

We segmented all the instances of tap and trill in intervocalic position which remember, it is the position in which both segments occur in contrastive position.
Here we have an example of tap and an example of trill segmentation. In this one the phonemic trill is produced as a longer tap, and in this example the phonemic trill is produced with trilling. 


---

# Data analysis

- Only instances of intervocalic taps and trills included in the analysis (N = 3354).

- Hierarchical Bayesian distributional regression:


  - Mean duration predicted by age (in years) * speaker group * segment type.

      * Group-level effects: varying intercepts by participant as well as a varying slope for segment type by participant.
  
  - Variance predicted by age (in years) * speaker group * segment type.
    * Group-level effects: varying intercepts by participant.
???



We modelled duration in millisecond of taps and trills using a hierarchical Bayesian distributional regression predicting changes in the conditional mean of segment duration as well as the variability of segment duration in the form of the standard deviation. Mean segment duration was predicted by the three-way interaction of age (in years), speaker group, and segment type. Group-level effects included varying intercepts by participant as well as a varying slope for segment type by participant. The variance was predicted by the same triple interaction with varying intercepts by participant.

In this graph we are showing the participant age in the x axis and the average segment duration in the y axis. In the two facets we have heritage speakers and speakers of Spanish raised in monolingual environments. Color-coded we have the tap and the trill. First of all, Our model shows a main effect of age, with segment duration decreasing on average as people get older. This could be due to speech rate, which we have not yet controlled for.

There is a main effect of speaker type, and monolinguals have longer segments overall compared to heritage speakers. So we can see that both lines are higher in the graph for the monolinguals than for the heritage speakers. We also found a main effect of segment type, trills are longer than taps (no surprise there)

An important finding here is an interaction between speaker type and segment: the difference between the tap and the trill is larger for monolinguals than for heritage speakers. With regards to age, we found that age impacts trill duration more than tap duration, and the trajectories for age in the context of the triple interaction are different. Monolingual trills get shorter while heritage trills do not get shorter, and might even get longer.

Next, we wanted to determine how variable this segments are. We fit a model that also explored how variable segment production was in terms of duration.  What changes in this graph from the graph before is that, In the y axis, we have now the duration standard deviation. First, we have strong evidence that segments become less variable as speakers get older, as we might expect. The two groups, however, were not different overall in terms of variability. And we also don't have evidence that the trills are more variable than the taps

# Interim discussion
RQ1: Is the tap-trill contrast maintained with duration in Spanish heritage speakers? Does it vary with age?

- Tap-trill contrast is maintained through duration but to a lesser extent in Spanish heritage speakers than in Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments.

- Age has a greater impact on trill duration than in tap duration.

- Target overshoot (trill duration decreasing with age) in Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments. 

???

Our findings show that Tap-trill contrast is maintained through duration but to a lesser extent in Spanish heritage speakers than in Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments. This suggests that, despite heritage speakers showing undershoot of trilling, they encode the tap trill contrast using secondary cues in this case. Age, in addition, has a more important role in tap duration than in trill duration, which is what we expect from the trill having a higher age of acquisition.

Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments may undergo a period of target overshoot (trill duration decreasing with age), while Spanish heritage speakers do not undergo this stage, and instead, trill duration increases with age.

Overshoot in the number of occlusions (Repiso-Puigdelliura, 2023)
&lt;img src="Figure4.png" width="600px" /&gt;


???
While we are still working on finalizing the categorization of number of occlusions in our complete data set. Here I show you some preliminary results published in the proceedings of the 48th Boston University Conference on language Development. In this figure we can see the number of occlusions only by the Spanish monolinguals and we observe this target overshoot around 7 to 8 years of age. That is, the target overshoot observed in the duration results is also observed in the prelimanry occlusions results.

---

# Interim discussion

RQ2: Are taps and trills more unstable (more variation) in Spanish heritage speakers than in Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments? Does it vary with age?


- Segment variability decreases with age. Tap and trill duration is more stable as grammars mature. From childhood to preadolescence, speakers are still controlling articulatory gestures in consonant production &lt;font size="3"&gt;(Athanasopoulou &amp; Vogel, 2016; Lee, Potamianos &amp; Narayanan, 1997; Lowenstein &amp; Nittrouer, 2008; Smith, 2006)&lt;/font&gt;.

- No evidence for differences in segment stability between groups.

???

With respect to the variability within the segments, our findings show that segment variability decreases with age, which could be explained by the fact that during childhood speakers are still controlling articulatory gestures and refining motor control abilities. However, we have no evidence that the Spanish heritage speakers produce segments with more variability than the Spanish speakers raised in monolingual environments. And this is an interesting finding because output variation is one of the characteristics of heritage language speech production. It could be, however, that since occlusions and manner of articulation may be more variable in the production of the taps and trills, duration needs to be more reliably encoded to maintain the tap-trill distinction. That is, the crucial role of duration may make it less variable in the speech production of heritage speakers.

---
# Discussion

- Rhotic system constitutes an area of vulnerability for heritage language speech production, presumably due to the articulatory complexity and gradient representations.

  - Output variation in trills: Maintenance of early variants of trill production.  
  - Possible maintenance of early consonant-to-consonant coarticulation in tap+ consonant clusters.
  
- Phonemic contrast is less stable but not lost.



  
  
- **Caveat**: dialectal variation in the ambient language &lt;font size="3"&gt;(Bradley &amp; Willis, 2012;Colantoni, 2006; Díaz-Campos,2008; Lastra &amp; Martín Butragueño, 2006; Lewis, 2004; Willis, 2006)&lt;/font&gt; as well as exposure to a different type of input could also influence variability in our results.


???

So, to conclude, late-developing sounds in heritage language speech production expose unique vulnerabilities for bilingual language development.First, for the trills, our research reveals that there's notable output variation, in the form of maintenance of early trill production variants, such as taps, or fricatives.
As for the intrusive vowels in consonant clusters, our research shows that, in some cases, adults keep consonant-to-consonant coarticulation, which could be a result of English overlapped consonant clusters delaying the acquisition of low overlap between consonant clusters.


In all these cases, however, it's crucial to acknowledge that dialectal variation in the ambient language as well as exposure to a different type of input could also influence variability in our results.

So, to conclude, we have been asking whether we observe attrition in complex phenomena in heritage language speech. First we have identified two complex areas that show  vulnerability in heritage language grammars. Sounds that are articulatorily complex show deceleration in the acquisition rates - they may require higher thresholds of input and use of the HL. Connected speech phenomena show transfer from English like strategy and may constitute a vulnerable areas because they are at the interface with prominence and interactis with lexical retrieval.

# General discussion

.pull-left[
**Complexity in heritage grammars**
-  Child heritage speakers show deceleration (i.e., when compared to age-matched speakers raised in monolingual environments) and a greater tendency to use English-like strategies than adult heritage speakers.

- Development is not halted during childhood (no differences) and knowledge is not attrited (adults overperforming children) - but we observe continued development.

- **Developing cognition**: Effects of language control may interact with the dominance shift - although speakers gain systematic exposure to the majority language they also learn to suppress the non-intended language.

???
Second, we have been asking whether we observe attrition in complex phenomena in heritage language speech. And our results do not support this hypothesis,  Instead what we observe is a trajectory of protracted but continued development. A possible dominance shift at the onset of school may result in the deceleration of the acquisition of the rhotic system during the school years, which, in turn, leads to the variation in the output that we observe during adulthood. This offers a new perspective in heritage language development, one in which there is no loss of the heritage language grammar, but rather a protracted but continued trajectory in the acquisition of the heritage language grammar, one that continues past the age of acquisition for speakers of raised in monolingual environments. It is possible that we are missing a piece of the puzzle which is that of the development of cognition. That is, maybe the shift in language dominance interacts with children developing better cognitive skills, which results in this continued development, but not in attrition patterns.

]
- Comparisons with first generation speakers:

    - Diversity of input?
    

- Child HS to adult HS (Polinsky, 2018)

    - The effects of reduced input along the heritage speakers' lifespan.
    - Delayed development vs. phonetic/phonological attrition?

???
- To understand whether divergent attainment is present in HS' grammars, researchers have compared these speakers to native speakers or first-generation speakers of the language. 

- Comparing speakers to native speakers has the problem of not understanding whether divergent attainment comes from reduced input or from an input with fewer trills.

- Comparing speakers to first generation speakers has the problem of not capturing the variation in the input of the speakers.

- The study compares the same population of speakers during childhood and adulthood to understand whether the results found in adult heritage speakers com from articulatory complexity (children are not provided enough input or output to develop the sound), the sound is developed but lack of practice as these speakers grow up results in articulatory attrition.

Adult heritage speakers have been compared to non-heritage speakers

Segments in which an apicoalveolar tap could be perceived but not seen in the spectrogram were classified as perceptual taps (N = 10, Freq = 0.52%). Non-tap articulated segments were labeled as other and contained fricatives (N = 39, Freq = 2.05%), laterals (N = 18, Freq = 0.94%), affricates (N = 1, Freq = 0.05%), tap + fricative (N = 19, Freq = 1%), trills  (N = 85, Freq = 4.46%), and elided taps (N = 8, Freq = 0.42%).

There are two scenarios that have been considered to connect the dots between the two populations. One is that of halted development, in which the outcomes observed during adulthood result from a cessation in the development of a sound or phonological process during the primary school years, as heritage speakers experience this dominance shift. The second is attrition, wherein heritage speakers acquire the main articulatory properties of a sound or phonological process, but, as a result of a dominance or proficiency shift, they lose some articulatory details, leading to these divergent outcomes during adulthood.

The graph on top shows the proportion of the distribution of each variant with grey for the adults and dark blue for the children. In the x axis we have the realizations going from phonetic trill in the left approximant trill, fricative variants, and tap variants int he right. What I want to show you in the graph is that the majority of the realizations of the adults concentrate around trill and fricative variants and the majority of the realizations of the children concentrate around the fricative and tap variation. The table in the right shows heritage speakers’ trill inventories based on the types that comprised more than 10% of their productions. All the heritage speakers used frication as one of the strategies to produce the trill, except for one child heritage speaker (CHS2) who consistently produced the tap variants. Almost half of the adult heritage speakers used both trill and frication while fewer than a third of the child
heritage speakers demonstrated this pattern.
 While most of them produced the trill variants more frequently than the variants
with frication, 1 adult heritage speaker and 1 child heritage speaker
primarily used frication to produce the trill. It is
important to note that the most frequent non-target-like inventory
found in the child heritage speaker data was frication and tap,
whereas for the adult heritage speakers it was the full inventory
(i.e., trill, frication, tap). This finding suggests that the child heritage speakers have not yet acquired the trill variants and the
adult heritage speakers, even after acquiring the trill variants,
have not abandoned the tap variants in their inventories.
